  question: "The guest says, 'Where is my refund? Iâ€™m still waiting.' The policy is NON-REFUNDABLE. What should the agent say?",
  options: [
    "I'll request a full refund for you.",
    "I'll open a case so our escalation team can review your situation.",
    "You're right, this is taking too long. I'll get it refunded."
  ],
  answer: "I'll open a case so our escalation team can review your situation.",
  explanation: "If the policy is non-refundable, agents should not promise a refund. Only escalate it without assuming the outcome."
},
{
  question: "The guest canceled a reservation that had a FREE CANCELLATION policy. What can the agent say?",
  options: [
    "I'll request a full refund from our escalation team.",
    "Thatâ€™s non-refundable, sorry.",
    "Thereâ€™s nothing we can do."
  ],
  answer: "I'll request a full refund from our escalation team.",
  explanation: "If the policy allows full refund, itâ€™s acceptable to request one through escalation â€” but the agent still shouldn't guarantee it."
},
{
  question: "The guest is angry. The policy is NON-REFUNDABLE. What should the agent avoid saying?",
  options: [
    "Iâ€™ll open a ticket and have the case reviewed.",
    "Iâ€™ll request a full refund.",
    "Let me explain the cancellation policy to you."
  ],
  answer: "Iâ€™ll request a full refund.",
  explanation: "This gives false hope when the policy doesn't allow refunds. Agents should explain and escalate only."
},
{
  question: "The guest says, 'I canceled within the free period and still didnâ€™t get money back.' Whatâ€™s the best agent response?",
  options: [
    "Iâ€™ll open a ticket for review since it was within the free cancellation window.",
    "You're totally right, I'll refund it myself.",
    "Thatâ€™s not my problem."
  ],
  answer: "Iâ€™ll open a ticket for review since it was within the free cancellation window.",
  explanation: "If within policy, escalate and note that. But still, don't promise the refund yourself."
},
{
  question: "When can an agent say 'Iâ€™ll request a full refund'?",
  options: [
    "When the policy clearly allows a free cancellation.",
    "Whenever the guest is angry.",
    "Always, just in case."
  ],
  answer: "When the policy clearly allows a free cancellation.",
  explanation: "Itâ€™s only appropriate when the policy supports it. Otherwise, escalate without promises."
},
{
  question: "A guest calls upset. The agent sees â€˜Non-Refundableâ€™ on the booking. What should the agent say?",
  options: [
    "Let me get you a full refund.",
    "Iâ€™ll open a case to be reviewed, but the policy is non-refundable.",
    "Thatâ€™s not my problem."
  ],
  answer: "Iâ€™ll open a case to be reviewed, but the policy is non-refundable.",
  explanation: "Youâ€™re being transparent but not giving away the bank. Thatâ€™s the correct balance."
},
{
  question: "The guest insists they were promised a refund earlier. The agent sees it was non-refundable. Whatâ€™s the correct response?",
  options: [
    "I'll issue it right now.",
    "I understand the confusion. Iâ€™ll open a case to have this reviewed.",
    "Okay, let me just process the refund."
  ],
  answer: "I understand the confusion. Iâ€™ll open a case to have this reviewed.",
  explanation: "Always show empathy, but never promise or issue anything outside policy."
},
{
  question: "The agent sees the policy was refundable, but past the cancellation window. Whatâ€™s the correct response?",
  options: [
    "I'll request a full refund for you.",
    "The window has passed, but Iâ€™ll escalate it for review.",
    "Itâ€™s refundable no matter what."
  ],
  answer: "The window has passed, but Iâ€™ll escalate it for review.",
  explanation: "You're acknowledging the guestâ€™s concern while still protecting the company from false promises."
},
{
  question: "The guest says: 'I just want my money back, I was told I could cancel!' The policy says non-refundable. What do you do?",
  options: [
    "Blame the hotel.",
    "Apologize and say you'll try to get a refund.",
    "Acknowledge their concern, explain the policy, and escalate the case."
  ],
  answer: "Acknowledge their concern, explain the policy, and escalate the case.",
  explanation: "Be empathetic but do not give false promises. Escalation is the correct step."
},
{
  question: "The guest is calm but confused about a charge. The booking is non-refundable. What should the agent do?",
  options: [
    "Explain the policy clearly and offer to escalate for review.",
    "Just refund to avoid conflict.",
    "Say nothing and hang up."
  ],
  answer: "Explain the policy clearly and offer to escalate for review.",
  explanation: "Even when calm, the same rules apply. Policy, empathy, and escalation â€” no promises."
